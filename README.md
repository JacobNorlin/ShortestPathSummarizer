# ShortestPathSummarizer
An automatic summarizer of text.

Based on this paper: https://www.nada.kth.se/~jsh/publications/shortpath.pdf

For course DD2418.

Cannot handle subsection titles properly, so text needs to sanitized of such parts.

Should probably be rewritten to me more scalaish as an exercise.

Can be build using sbt-assembly.

Run with the following arguments:

pathtofile targetnumberofwords

pathtofile targetnumberofwords numberofpaths
